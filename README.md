# candle-ocr-server

This is a small server and web app that leverages the open source transformer based OCR model `microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten` for optical character recognition from freeform text and photos. 

This app is built on `candle`, `poem`, `svelte` and `fly`.

### TLDR; üïπÔ∏è Play with it now

Try it out at https://ocr.dholtz.com

**Note: the app performance may be impacted by other users since the model is running on a small CPU bound VM.

# oooo, show me what it does üöÄ

## Detect from freeform

Note: the model has been trained on single line text and works best with similar input
